  <p>This is my first ever post on the blog! So I thought I&#39;d write a little on how I set this blog up.</p>

<p><a href="http://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a> are built with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> and I spent the morning reading the Jekyll documentation. It is really well documented and makes it really easy to start creating a blog. The posts can be written in Markdown and is automatically converted to HTML. It also uses the Liquid templating language which is really similar to the Django templating language.</p>

<p>So once I got the hang of how Jekyll works, I decided to write my own CSS rules for the look. I had a design in mind but halfway through I got bored and decided to use a theme instead :P. So on searching, I found this theme called <a href="http://hyde.getpoole.com">Hyde</a>. It was almost exactly what I had in mind and I decided to give it a try.</p>

<p>Getting the theme integrated was easy as all you had to was to download the GitHub repo and copy it to the blog directory. I then changed the values in the _config.yaml file to ones specific to my site. So now it was almost done. But I wanted to add a archive link also. That was easy using the templating language. And then all that was left was to write this post!</p>

<p>You can find the code <a href="http://github.com/rohitvarkey/rohitvarkey.github.io">here</a>. Thanks for reading! </p>
