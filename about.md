Hey there! This is Rohit Varkey Thankachan's blog, a Computer Science Masters student at [Georgia Tech](http://www.gatech.edu/).
I am passionate about the open source and am a Pythonista. I've contributed to several packages in the Julia community. My resume can be found [here]({{site.url}}/public/Rohit-Varkey-Thankachan-Resume.pdf). 

I completed my undergrad at [National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal](http://nitk.ac.in) in May 2016.

I enjoy soccer and am also a Kerala Blasters and Manchester United fan!
