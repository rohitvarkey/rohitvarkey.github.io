This is my first ever post on the blog! So I thought I'd write a little on how I set this blog up.

[GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com) are built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I spent the morning reading the Jekyll documentation. It is really well documented and makes it really easy to start creating a blog. The posts can be written in Markdown and is automatically converted to HTML. It also uses the Liquid templating language which is really similar to the Django templating language.


So once I got the hang of how Jekyll works, I decided to write my own CSS rules for the look. I had a design in mind but halfway through I got bored and decided to use a theme instead :P. So on searching, I found this theme called [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com). It was almost exactly what I had in mind and I decided to give it a try.


Getting the theme integrated was easy as all you had to was to download the GitHub repo and copy it to the blog directory. I then changed the values in the _config.yaml file to ones specific to my site. So now it was almost done. But I wanted to add a archive link also. That was easy using the templating language. And then all that was left was to write this post!

You can find the code [here](http://github.com/rohitvarkey/rohitvarkey.github.io). Thanks for reading!
